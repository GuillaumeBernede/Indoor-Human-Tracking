# Indoor-Human-Tracking
This project presents a lightweight Tiny ML pipeline for indoor human‐position tracking using a four‐antenna UWB radar operating at 25 Hz over a 4–5 m range. Raw radar returns are preprocessed to generate Range–Angle maps, which are then fed into a compact FOMO object‐detection model.
